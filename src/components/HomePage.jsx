                  Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime
                  environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web
                  browser.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It enables developers to use JavaScript to write command-line
                  tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts
                  server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the
                  page is sent to the user's web browser.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere"
                  paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single
                  programming language, rather than different languages for
                  server- and client-side scripts.

                  ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, introduced significant
                  improvements to the JavaScript language, including new syntax
